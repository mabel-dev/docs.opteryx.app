# Opteryx Docs - Minimal Next.js + MDX scaffold

This folder contains a minimal Next.js (app router) + MDX scaffold for trying the GitHub-style rendering engine.

Getting started:

```bash
cd docs-site
npm install
npm run dev
```

Notes:
- This is intentionally minimal: extend layout, navigation, and styles as needed.
